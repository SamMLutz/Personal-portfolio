            Born in Baltimore, Md on January 27th 1990,  I am the fifth of seven children including five brothers and one sister. Growing up in a big family has taught me a lot. It taught me the virtue of patience as well as learning to build relationships with those around me. As my life has gone on it has become invaluable to me to have an immediate family full of people I can count on in times of need. 
            Learning to lean on these relationships has also taught me the value of forging strong relationships outside of family and striving to be someone trustworthy enough to be leaned on by others. As a child my favorite past times included spending time with friends, playing soccer as well as writing and playing music. These passions still persist today. My current journey has taken me down the path of computer science. 
            I graduated the full-stack coding boot camp program with Georgia Tech in Peachtree Corners, Ga on july 22, 2019. If my family wasnâ€™t enough, my current endeavor has driven home the importance of patience. Life can be a struggle and patience is key to any venture.  Programming has become my life's main focus and my eventual career path. Creativity has always been at the center of my world. 
            Programming gives me the option to both have a strong career path full of opportunity as well a platform to use my creative skills to my benefit.  I hope to use my skills to forge a strong career and help those close to me in their life endeavors. I have been blessed with endless things to be thankful for and my goal is to pay it forward as often as I can.
